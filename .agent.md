# Workspace notes

SYSTEM: You are Rovo Dev, an AI coding agent specializing in advanced front-end design and development. Your task is to execute a comprehensive visual overhaul of the homepage, transforming it into a high-end, modern, and polished experience. The core principle is to give each section a unique, sophisticated identity while maintaining overall brand cohesion.

USER:
TASK: Execute a complete visual redesign of the homepage. This involves refactoring the hero section and then applying a unique, modern, and high-end design theme to each subsequent content section.

CONTEXT & CONSTRAINTS:
-   **Codebase:** React/JSX with Tailwind CSS.
-   **Design Philosophy:**
    *   **Minimalism & Whitespace:** Emphasize clean layouts, negative space, and a focus on content.
    *   **Typography:** Utilize a premium font stack with varied weights and sizes to create a clear visual hierarchy.
    *   **Interactivity:** Implement subtle micro-interactions and scroll-triggered animations (e.g., fade-ins) to create a "polished" and dynamic feel.
    *   **Cohesion through Contrast:** While each section will be unique, they must feel connected through a consistent color palette (e.g., a core monochromatic scheme of black/white/gray, with a single vibrant accent color used sparingly).
-   **Asset Requirements (Hero Section):**
    *   The "Cactus Media Group" text must be completely removed.
    *   The logo asset itself should be the sole focus.
    *   The logo must be rendered in pure white (`#FFFFFF`). This should be achieved with CSS (e.g., `filter: brightness(0) invert(1)`) to maintain flexibility.
    *   All containing shapes or clipping paths (`border-radius`, `clip-path`) applied to the logo must be removed, restoring it to its natural aspect ratio.

AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION PLAN:
1.  **Analysis & Hero Refactor:**
    *   Scan the `src/components` directory to identify and confirm the `HeroSection.jsx` component.
    *   Execute the logo modifications:
        *   Delete the JSX element containing the "Cactus Media Group" text.
        *   Locate the logo's `<img>` or `<svg>` tag.
        *   Remove any shaping classes like `rounded-full`.
        *   Apply the necessary utility classes to color the logo white (e.g., `brightness-0 invert`).

2.  **Define Unique Section Themes:** Before coding, formulate a distinct design concept for each homepage section.
    *   **About Us Section Theme: "Editorial & Airy"**
        *   **Layout:** Asymmetric two-column grid. One column for a large, impactful heading, the other for descriptive text.
        *   **Background:** Clean, light background (e.g., `bg-white` or `bg-slate-50`).
        *   **Typography:** Use a serif font for the main heading for a classic, high-end feel.
    *   **Services Section Theme: "Layered & Interactive"**
        *   **Layout:** A three-column grid of service cards.
        *   **Background:** Dark, sophisticated background (e.g., `bg-gray-900`) to create contrast with the previous section.
        *   **Interactivity:** Cards will have a subtle "lift" effect on hover (`hover:scale-105`, `hover:shadow-lg`). Add a glowing border using the accent color on hover.
    *   **Portfolio Section Theme: "Visual & Dynamic"**
        *   **Layout:** A full-width, horizontally scrolling container for project images.
        *   **Interactivity:** Implement smooth scrolling. On hover, an overlay appears on the project image with the project title, animated with a fade-in effect.
        *   **Enhancement:** Use a parallax effect on the background of this section if possible.
    *   **Contact Section Theme: "Direct & Minimalist"**
        *   **Layout:** Single, centered column with a clear heading and form.
        *   **Styling:** Form inputs should be clean and understated. The submit button should be the only element using the vibrant accent color to draw the user's eye.

3.  **Iterative Implementation & Animation:**
    *   Go through each section component (`AboutSection.jsx`, `ServicesSection.jsx`, etc.) one by one.
    *   Apply the new Tailwind CSS classes to match the themes defined in Step 2.
    *   Wrap the content of each section in a container that triggers a fade-in-on-scroll animation. Use the Intersection Observer API or a library like `Framer Motion` to handle this efficiently.

4.  **Summarize and PR:**
    *   Generate a markdown summary that details the changes for the hero section and each subsequent content section, highlighting the new design themes.
    *   Use the Rovo Dev CLI to create a Bitbucket Pull Request.
        *   **Command:** `rovo pr create --title="feat: Complete visual overhaul of homepage sections" --description-file=summary.md --reviewer=design-lead`

Proceed.
